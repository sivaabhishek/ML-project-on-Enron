# ML-project-on-Enron-dataset

In late 2001, Enron, an American energy company, filed for bankruptcy after one of the largest financial scandals in corporate history. After the company's collapse, over 600,000 emails generated by 158 Enron employees - now known as the Enron Corpus - were acquired by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation. The data was then uploaded online, and since then, a number of people and organizations have graciously prepared, cleaned and organized the dataset that is available to the public today (a few years later, financial data of top Enron executives were released following their trial).

Today, the Enron Corpus is the largest and one of the only publicly available mass collections of real emails easily accessible for study. This excerpt from an article in MIT Technology Review summarizes the value of such a dataset.

## Project Goal

The aim of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that identifies Enron employees that may have committed fraud based on their financial and email data.The goal of this project is to use the Enron dataset to train our machine learning algorithm to detect the possiblity of fraud (identify person's of interest.) Since we know our persons of interest (POIs) in our dataset, we will be able to use supervised learning algorithms in constructing our POI identifier. This will be done by picking the features within our dataset that separate our POIs from our non-POIs best.
## Requirements 

* Python
* Scikit-learn library

## Steps to run program

Check for the necessary requirements by running tools/startup.py then run the final_project/emails.py so that it will generate the word_data.pkl and then finally run the final_project/tester.py.
